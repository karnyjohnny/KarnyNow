## Current status (updated 2026-10-21)

| Stage | State |
|---|---|
| **0 — measurements** | **COMPLETE.** G0.1 CPU ✅ · G0.2 D3D9 presentation ✅ **(T4 v4)** · G0.3 toolchain ✅ · G0.4 console ✅ |
| **1 — C skeleton offline + logging subsystem** | **IN PROGRESS — logging+FEC+SRTP-p1 VERIFIED ON TARGET (T9 ALL PASS); SRTP phase 2 written, awaiting T9.** T9 round 1 (2026-10-21): cmake build rc=0 **warnings=0** on GCC 16.2 (confirms the `-Wstring-compare` fix); `test_knlog` 105 PASS, `test_knring` 34 PASS, **`test_knsrtp` 37 PASS** (RFC 3711 B.2/B.3 + FIPS-197 vectors byte-exact with vendored tiny-AES-c), `test_knfec` 122/125 — the 3 failures were a test-side state leak in `test_error_paths` (fixed; knfec logic proven by 200/200 property round-trips + all KATs). T9 itself had a Windows `subprocess` cwd/exe-path trap → fixed (absolute paths). Next T9 re-run should be fully green. Then: SRTP phase 2 (HMAC/replay), diagnostic bundle, `knvstd --loopback`. |
| 2–5 | not started |

Gate G0.2 evidence and the settled presentation chain: `docs/analysis/G0.2-T4v4-RESULTS.md`.
One-line summary: **NV12 `StretchRect` from a DEFAULT-pool surface into the backbuffer
works (S_OK, 3.0 ms incl. Present); SYSTEMMEM NV12 fill crashes the driver (0xC0000005,
both arches, exact call isolated) and is permanently excluded.**

## Decision register — additions this session

D1–D13 are in `BOOTSTRAP.md` §4 (unchanged, except D7 settled below).

| # | Decision | Reason / source | Reversal condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D7 (settled)** | Presentation chain: NV12 DEFAULT → `StretchRect(LINEAR)` → backbuffer; fallbacks YUY2 → X8R8G8B8 → GDI `SetDIBitsToDevice`. No SYSTEMMEM NV12, no offscreen conversion targets, `CheckDeviceFormatConversion` before every `StretchRect`, permanent degrade on AV. | T4 v4 measurement; `docs/analysis/G0.2-T4v4-RESULTS.md` §5 | none expected |
| **D14** | Default video mode **720p30**, switchable. Both mechanisms: a **settings screen** choice (applied at launch) **and an F7 in-session hotkey** cycling 720p30 → 540p60 → 540p30 → 360p30. In-session application needs renegotiation (`dynamicStreamingMode` / re-ANNOUNCE) = stage 5; until then F7 queues the choice for the next launch and says so on screen. | User answer to open question Q2 ("720p default, switchability nice; F7 vs settings — don't know") → provide both, staged honestly | user preference |
| **D15** | Game list = **account library only** (`filters: {variants:{gfn:{library:{status:{notEquals:"NOT_OWNED"}}}}}`), not the full GFN catalog. R24 pagination guards (context hash + revision re-check before/after each page) still mandatory. | User answer Q3 (uses GFN for owned/free-to-play games) | user preference |
| **D16** | Stream renders in a **separate window**; all keyboard/mouse capture lives in the streamer process; the Python TUI stays in the console. (Confirms the BOOTSTRAP §3 architecture — was a recommendation, now a user requirement.) | User answer Q4 | — |
| **D17** | Artwork: **text-only game list for stage 4**. A bounded local artwork cache may be added behind a flag after G4 (disk + HTTP cache on a 2 GB machine — deferred, non-blocking). | User answer Q5 ("don't know") → decide by not blocking on it | revisit after G4 |

## Risk register — changes this session

| # | Change |
|---|---|
| R2 | **CLOSED** (T4 v4: NV12 path works; crashing variant isolated and excluded) |
| R2b | **CLOSED** (v4 writer preserved all data through a crashing run — pattern proven; the same rules ship in the client per §7.12) |
| R9 | **Mitigated** (60 Hz available and active; user keeps 60 Hz on battery; D9 stands) |
| R17 | **CLOSED** (GPU does CSC + scale; CPU never touches pixels) |
| **R25 (new)** | Writing into a **locked DEFAULT NV12** surface is the only video-path operation not yet exercised (lock itself verified OK, pitch = width). P=low, S=high. Mitigation: stage-1 milestone 0 = `knvstd --selftest=d3d.present` fills + presents once in an isolated process **before** the 10-minute G1 run. |
| **R15 (impl round II)** | **Mostly closed.** T8 on the target resolved all 14 Python packages rc=0 (pip honours Requires-Python, so every pin declares 3.8 support): textual 6.2.1, rich 14.3.4, httpx 0.28.1, httpcore 1.0.9, h11 0.16.0, anyio 4.5.2, + 8 more — `python/requirements.txt` updated, wheels cached on target in `tests\t8_wheels\`. Remaining: offline install + runtime smoke at stage 4 (httpx 0.28 removed `proxies=`; textual 6.x API churn vs old docs). |
| **R26 (new)** | **Sandbox has no compiler and must not install one** (apt installs fail with infrastructure errors; packages do not persist across turns anyway). The compile gate is the TARGET machine: `tests/T9_build_and_test.py` (w64devkit GCC 16.2 + cmake + ninja — the authoritative toolchain; it caught a `-Wstring-compare` that sandbox GCC 12 missed). Consequence: C leaving this workspace is compiled by the user, so review it line-by-line before handing over and keep changes per round small. |

Everything else (R3 usrsctp/DTLS spike, R7 first real `POST v2/session`, R22 31-field
session context, R23 RESUME, R24 catalog revision binding) unchanged — see BOOTSTRAP §9.

## Next steps (ordered)

1. **T9 on the target** (user): `python tests\T9_build_and_test.py` → send back
   `T9_skrot.txt` (+ `T9_wynik.txt` on failure). One gate for everything
   pending: the `-Wstring-compare` fix under GCC 16.2, first compile of
   `knfec`/`test_knfec` and `kn_aes`/`knsrtp`/`test_knsrtp` (+ vendored
   tiny-AES-c), and re-run of knlog/knring + JSONL validation on Win7.
2. **SRTP phase 2**: vetted HMAC-SHA1 (or mbedTLS), auth tag with `be32(roc)`
   placement (nvst.rs:2820-2872), 2048-packet replay window + ROC estimation
   (nvst.rs:2635-2705), SRTCP E-bit/index (nvst.rs:4357-4372). Checklist in
   `docs/SRTP.md`. mbedTLS vendoring decision lands here (TLS/WSS needs it at
   stage 2 anyway; F1 flags + `_WIN32_WINNT=0x0601` for every vendored file).
3. **Diagnostic bundle (§7.8)**: store-only zip writer in C, `summary.json`
   first, registered as a `kn_log_on_failure` callback; ring dumps wired in.
4. **`knvstd` skeleton**: `--loopback` decode `.264` (FFmpeg, `threads=1`) →
   DEFAULT NV12 → StretchRect → Present; WASAPI synthetic PCM; self-tests.
   Milestone 0 = R25 probe (fill locked DEFAULT NV12 in an isolated process).
   Gate G1 = 30 fps × 10 min, CPU within budget, RSS flat, complete bundle
   with no network involved.
5. Stage 4 prep: `pip install --no-index --find-links tests\t8_wheels
   -r python\requirements.txt` on the target when the TUI work starts.

Maps onto the user's repo `C:\Users\KarnyJohnny\Desktop\NewKarnyNow\` — new dirs merge
with the existing `tests/` (T1–T7 harnesses stay where they are; T4 v4 results already
archived here as well).

## Working agreements (carried over, still binding)

- Measure first, then code; every stage has a gate; a failed gate is information.
- **R26: the sandbox has no compiler and must not install one.** The compile
  gate is the TARGET machine: `tests/T9_build_and_test.py` (w64devkit GCC 16.2 +
  cmake + ninja — authoritative; stricter than the old sandbox GCC 12). Review
  C line-by-line before handing over; keep per-round C deltas small.
- Compile before handing over (when a compiler exists: `tools/build_native_tests.sh`,
  `tools/cross_check.sh`); zero warnings with `-Wall -Wextra`.
- Keep artefacts small: every big JSON gets a `*_skrot`/`*_summary` sibling.
- Isolate anything that can crash (separate process / SEH marker before risky calls).
- Name unknowns explicitly (`NOT VERIFIED` / `UNVERIFIED` labels in code).
- Never disable TLS verification; never bypass login/entitlements/queue; no network in
  MOCK mode; secrets logged as lengths/presence only (whitelist redaction at the logging
  boundary).

## Session log (implementation)

### 2026-10-21 · impl round I
Received T4 v4 results (`T4_wynik.json` complete this time — writer fix proven) and the
user's answers to the five open questions. Analysed the run: G0.2 **closed**, D7
**settled** (NV12 StretchRect primary; SYSTEMMEM NV12 fill isolated as the crashing call
and excluded; offscreen conversion targets refused with `D3DERR_INVALIDCALL`; harness
`srf_*` mask bug documented), R2/R2b/R17 closed, R9 mitigated, R25 opened (DEFAULT NV12
fill → stage-1 milestone 0). Recorded D14–D17 from the user's answers. Built the
implementation workspace; wrote the C logging subsystem core + ring buffers + unit tests
(BOOTSTRAP §7, D13); drafted cp38 `requirements.txt` and the T8 dependency probe for the
user. → `docs/analysis/G0.2-T4v4-RESULTS.md`

### 2026-10-21 · impl round II
User ran the Win7 build (cmake 4.4.3 + ninja, w64devkit GCC 16.2.0):
**test_knlog 105 checks PASS, test_knring 34 checks PASS on the target** —
real Win7 file/rename/flush semantics verified. GCC 16 caught one warning the
sandbox GCC 12 had missed (`-Wstring-compare` in `kn_redact_key_is_secret`
when inlined into `kn_log_on_failure` with short literal keys) → fixed with a
`strstr(norm,"srtp")==norm` prefix test (fix awaits T9 verification).
**T8 resolved R15**: all 14 cp38 packages downloadable rc=0; pins recorded in
`python/requirements.txt`; wheels cached in `tests\t8_wheels\` on the target.
**Sandbox lost its toolchain** (apt installs now fail with infrastructure
errors) → new binding agreement **R26**: no toolchain installs in the
sandbox; the target machine is the compile authority via
`tests/T9_build_and_test.py` (new: cmake/ninja build with direct-gcc fallback,
runs all three test binaries + JSONL validation, emits `T9_skrot.txt`).
**FEC half of BOOTSTRAP §13.3 delivered (pending compile)**: fetched full
`nvst.rs` @ a49b124 into `artifacts/nvst-extract/`, extracted the exact GF/
Cauchy/reconstruction rules with line provenance (`docs/FEC.md`), wrote
`tools/fec_reference.py` (independent Python port; self-check reproduces the
reference's own test `nvst.rs:13239`), generated `knfec_tables.h` +
`knfec_kat_vectors.h`, implemented `streamer/src/knfec.c` (zero-allocation
encoder + Gauss-Jordan reconstruction) and `streamer/tests/test_knfec.c`
(tables-vs-definition sweep of all 65 536 products, golden Cauchy matrices,
nvst.rs:13239 port, zero-padding semantics, wide-block encode KAT, 200
deterministic property round-trips, error paths). Created `AGENT-HANDOFF.md`
(recovery document for a future agent, with the file list to attach).
→ `docs/FEC.md`, `tests/T9_build_and_test.py`, `AGENT-HANDOFF.md`

### 2026-10-21 · impl round III
Resend of the "no sandbox toolchain" instruction → scanned the workspace (all
round-II artefacts intact) and continued the queue with the SRTP KDF/IV half
of BOOTSTRAP §13.3. Fetched RFC 3711 text and read the vector appendices from
source (B.2 = AES-CM, B.3 = KDF — the common "B.1 is the KDF" assumption from
memory was WRONG; fetching caught it). Extracted nvst.rs crypto facts:
labels 0x00/0x01/0x02 SRTP + 0x03/0x05 SRTCP (88-95), profile set incl. GCM_8
and AES-256 variants (301-330), KDF/IV layouts (2873-2939). Vendored
tiny-AES-c (Unlicense, sha256 recorded, PROVENANCE.md) behind a `kn_aes`
wrapper with a compile-time size assertion; wrote `knsrtp` (KDF + AES-CM
keystream + three IV builders, zero allocation) and `test_knsrtp` (~40 checks
against FIPS-197/SP800-38A/RFC-3711-B.2/B.3 goldens + cross-impl vectors).
`tools/srtp_reference.py` self-proves its pure-Python AES against all RFC
constants before emitting vectors — and immediately earned its keep: the first
S-box draft degenerated because **AES's 0x11B is not primitive (ord(0x02)=51;
the S-box needs generator 0x03, unlike FEC's 0x11D where 0x02 works)** —
recorded as a landmine. Wired test_knsrtp into CMakeLists/T9/shell gates;
docs/SRTP.md written (incl. the phase-2 checklist: HMAC-SHA1 + be32(roc),
replay window, SRTCP, mbedTLS decision). knfec + knsrtp now share one gate:
T9 on the target.
→ `docs/SRTP.md`, `streamer/src/{kn_aes.c,knsrtp.c}`, `streamer/tests/{test_knsrtp.c,knsrtp_kat_vectors.h}`, `third_party/tiny-aes-c/`, `tools/srtp_reference.py`

### 2026-10-21 · impl round IV
First T9 run on the target. **cmake build rc=0, warnings=0 under GCC 16.2**
(the `-Wstring-compare` fix is confirmed). Manual runs (T9's exe launch hit a
Windows trap, below): **test_knlog 105/105 PASS, test_knring 34/34 PASS,
test_knsrtp 37/37 PASS** — SRTP phase 1 reproduces FIPS-197/SP800-38A/RFC
3711 B.2 (incl. the FEFF→FF00 counter carry) and B.3 (incl. the 94-octet
auth key) byte-for-byte with the vendored tiny-AES-c on the production
toolchain. **test_knfec 122/125**: property round-trips 200/200 and every
golden vector PASS; the 3 failures were a test-side state leak in
`test_error_paths` (NULL `shards[2]` carried between subcases → `-2` fired
before the tested behaviour). Fixed: each subcase now sets full explicit
state. Two harness bugs fixed: (1) T9 launched test exes with relative paths
while passing `cwd` to Popen — on Windows the executable path resolves
against the CALLER's cwd, not the `cwd` argument (documented Python
behaviour) → absolute paths now, comment added; (2) same trap noted in
`run_tests` for future agents. Stage-1 crypto+FEC cores are now target-
verified; remaining gate: clean T9 re-run.
→ `streamer/tests/test_knfec.c` (fix), `tests/T9_build_and_test.py` (fix)

### 2026-10-21 · impl round V
**First T9 run: VERDICT ALL PASS.** cmake build rc=0 **warnings=0** (GCC 16.2),
test_knlog 105/105, test_knring 34/34, test_knfec **125/125** (error-path fix
confirmed; property 200/200), test_knsrtp 37/37, JSONL validation PASS. The
crypto/FEC/logging verification chapter is closed for phase 1.
Then implemented **SRTP phase 2** (from `nvst.rs`, read not remembered):
vendored Brad Conte SHA-1 (public domain, sha256 recorded) behind `kn_sha1`
with RFC 3174 KAT; HMAC-SHA1 RFC 2104 glue with RFC 2202 cases 1-7 KAT;
`kn_srtp_auth_tag`/`verify_tag` (be32(roc) suffix, constant-time compare,
authenticate-before-decrypt); `protect/unprotect_cm_hmac` in-place (ROC
derived from packet_index internally — no inconsistent-pair footgun);
`kn_srtp_replay` window 1:1 from nvst.rs:3121-3211 (guess/check/commit,
2048 packets, 32xu64 bitmask, defensive no-op instead of the reference's
panic). Evidence that **SRTCP-CM is not needed** (nvst SRTCP is GCM-only;
RR rides DTLS-encrypted `rtcp1` SCTP). `srtp_reference.py` extended: p2
self-check (RFC3174 x4 via hashlib oracle, RFC2202 x7, protect goldens with
B.3-derived session material, 96-op replay script vs a line-by-line python
port of ReplayWindow) — the generator caught my TEST4 transcription error
(TEST4a+TEST4b = 64-byte base, not 32) before emission, twice proving the
"vectors self-prove first" rule. test_knsrtp extended (~35 new checks;
~72 total). CMake/T9/shell gates updated for the new sources. Everything
awaits the next T9 run.
-> `streamer/src/kn_sha1.c`, `streamer/src/knsrtp.c` (phase 2),
